# RevSeek

![](revseek.gif)

For Australians looking at job ads on Seek, it's sometimes not obvious what the expected salary range for the advertised position is. With some search filter trickery you can often determine an accurate range for the salary but this process can be a little bit cumbersome.

I created this small app to streamline that process. All you need is the full URL for the job listing and then you let the app work its magic! ðŸ¤˜

The logic for this app is largely borrowed from this bash script:
