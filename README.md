# RevSeek

![](revseek.gif)

For Australians looking at job ads on Seek, it's sometimes not obvious what the expected salary range for the advertised position is. With some search filter trickery you can often determine an accurate range for the salary but this process can be a little bit cumbersome.

I created this small app to streamline that process and to familiarise myself with **Heroku**, **Node/Express**, and **Github Pages**.

All you need is the full URL for the job listing and then you let the app work its magic! ðŸ¤˜

Go here to see it in action:
~~https://epsilon42.github.io/revseek/~~ (no longer works due to Heroku removing free tier) 

**Note:** The above demo uses an Express server that's hosted on a free Heroku plan so the dyno sometimes takes a moment to start/respond. For a faster app experience setup the Express server locally.

The logic for this app is largely borrowed from this bash script:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
